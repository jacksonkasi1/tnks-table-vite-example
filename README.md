# React + TypeScript + Vite + shadcn/ui

This is a template for a new Vite project with React, TypeScript, and shadcn/ui showing how to implement the Advanced Data Table component.

## About the Data Table

This project implements the **Advanced Data Table Component** from [tnks-data-table](https://github.com/jacksonkasi1/tnks-data-table).

It is a highly configurable and feature-rich table implementation built on top of Shadcn UI components and TanStack Table (React Table v8). Designed to handle enterprise-level requirements including complex data operations, server-side processing, and customizable UI elements.

*   **Hierarchical Data**: Support for expandable subrows (e.g., orders with items).
*   **UI Features**: Column resizing, visibility toggles, date range filtering, and customizable toolbars.
*   **Operations**: Bulk actions, row actions, and data export (CSV/Excel).
*   **Integration**: Built with React Query, Zod validation, and React Hook Form.
